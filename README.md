# MIT-Python-6.0001
Solutions to the problem sets from MIT's OpenCourseWare course '6.0001 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python' (Fall 2016 version).
The link to the course is https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/index.htm

My solutions are contained in the files starting with 'ps' and not ending in 'test' (for example ps5.py contains my solution but ps5_test.py contains none of my work), and were created using framework provided by MIT. Any other files are entirely from MIT.
