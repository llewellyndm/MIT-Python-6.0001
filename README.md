# MIT-Python-6.0001
Solutions to the problem sets from MIT's OpenCourseWare course '6.0001 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python' (Fall 2016 version).
The link to the course is https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/index.htm

My solutions are the files starting with 'ps' (for example 'ps4a') and were created using framework provided by MIT. Any other files are entirely from MIT.
